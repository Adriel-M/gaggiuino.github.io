# Recommendations
## Soldering 
* Start by selecting the appropriate soldering iron for your project. The size and wattage of the iron should be suitable for the job at hand.
* Use a clean, flat surface to work on. This will help to ensure that your soldering iron has a stable base and that your soldering work is precise.
* Use a good quality soldering wire. Poor quality wire can contain impurities that can affect the strength and reliability of your soldered joints.
* Clean the surfaces to be soldered with a fine abrasive pad or a wire brush. This will help to remove any dirt or oxidation, which can prevent a strong bond from forming.
* Tin the soldering iron by applying a small amount of solder to the tip. This will help to transfer heat more efficiently and make it easier to apply the solder to the joint.
* Take your time, rushing won't help you at all.
* Use the "Western Union" splice to link wires (GND and 5v)
* Tin your wires to make them easier to solder.
* When soldering, be sure to use the right amount of heat and solder. Too little heat will result in a weak joint, while too much heat can cause the components to become damaged.
* After soldering, allow the joint to cool naturally before handling. Sudden movements or stress on the joint while it is still hot can weaken the bond.
*Finally, be sure to clean up any excess solder or flux from the soldered joint to ensure a clean and professional finish. Overall, good soldering requires a combination of skill, patience, and the right tools and materials. With practice, you will be able to achieve strong and reliable soldered joints.
