This article is not aimed at seasoned DIY enthusiasts who already possess a comprehensive set of tools. Instead, it's designed for primarily kit installers, offering beginner-friendly and budget-aware advice for those without extensive prior experience.

## Insulated Cable Crimper

An insulated cable crimper is crucial for fitting insulated ends, like Quick Connects (QCs) or Spades, onto cables. The insulation color on these connectors corresponds to the hole size, aiding in selecting the right connector for a given cable. For single cables, a red-insulated connector should be used, matching the crimper's red slot. For two cables going into a connector, use a connection with blue insulation.

Follow this step-by-step guide to utilize an insulated crimper effectively, with an example model: [Example Crimper](https://pl.aliexpress.com/item/1005005812085022.html).

1. **Cable Preparation**: Start by stripping about 6mm off the cable's insulation.
2. **Crimper Slot Selection**: Choose the crimper slot that matches the color of your connector (e.g., red for standard single cables).
3. **Securing the Connector**: Insert the connector into the appropriate slot of the crimper and lightly squeeze to keep it in place.
4. **Inserting the Cable and Crimping**: Place the stripped cable end into the connector. Ensure it's fully inserted before squeezing the crimper handles together to attach the connector firmly.
5. **Verify the connection**: Pull gently on a cable. If it's not held secure, cut the connector with pliers and redo the process.

## Uninsulated cable crimper

You'll use an uninsulated cable crimper mainly for BN connectors, also known as butt connectors, to join two high-voltage cables. Utilize BN 1.25 connectors for joining single cables and BN 2 for connecting pairs of cables into one connector. The essential tools for working with these uninsulated terminals are a punch and block, commonly used alongside electrician pliers. Remember to put insulation on top of those connections. Refer to the images below for guidance:

## Pliers - Optional

When cutting cables, especially in hard-to-reach areas, having dedicated pliers can be invaluable, as regular scissors may not suffice. Various models are available; here is an example: [Cable Cutting Pliers](https://pl.aliexpress.com/item/4001146365274.html).

## Cable stripper - Optional

While an automated wire stripper is a convenient tool, it's not essential. You can accomplish all necessary stripping tasks with tools like pliers. Automated strippers offer useful features, such as the ability to adjust automatically to the cable's width for stripping and pulling, and pre-configured stripping lengths. For instance, when inserting two cables into the same connector, an automated stripper can ensure they are stripped to the exact same length, like 6mm, which is highly convenient.

However, for kits that include low-voltage work, such as tiny JST cables, an automated stripper might not be suitable as it could pull the cables apart. If stripping ever results in any metal strands coming off with the insulation, trim the end and strip again. For low-voltage cable stripping, gently heating the insulation and then pulling it off with pliers or even fingers, without cutting, can be effective. This method, as demonstrated in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5o2drU65UM), can be used.
