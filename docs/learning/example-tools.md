## Insulated Cable Crimper

An insulated cable crimper is crucial for fitting insulated ends, like Quick Connects (QCs) or Spades, onto cables. The insulation color on these connectors corresponds to the hole size, aiding in selecting the right connector for a given cable. For single cables, a red-insulated connector should be used, matching the crimper's red slot. For two cables going into a connector, use a connection with blue insulation.

Follow this step-by-step guide to utilize an insulated crimper effectively, with an example model: [Example Crimper](https://pl.aliexpress.com/item/1005005812085022.html).

1. **Cable Preparation**: Start by stripping about 6mm off the cable's insulation.
2. **Crimper Slot Selection**: Choose the crimper slot that matches the color of your connector (e.g., red for standard single cables).
3. **Securing the Connector**: Insert the connector into the appropriate slot of the crimper and lightly squeeze to keep it in place.
4. **Inserting the Cable and Crimping**: Place the stripped cable end into the connector. Ensure it's fully inserted before squeezing the crimper handles together to attach the connector firmly.
5. **Verify the connection**: Pull gently on a cable. If it's not held secure, cut the connector with pliers and redo the process.

## Uninsulated cable crimper

You'll use an uninsulated cable crimper mainly for BN connectors, also known as butt connectors, to join two high-voltage cables. Utilize BN 1.25 connectors for joining single cables and BN 2 for connecting pairs of cables into one connector. The essential tools for working with these uninsulated terminals are a punch and block, commonly used alongside electrician pliers. Remember to put insulation on top of those connections.
