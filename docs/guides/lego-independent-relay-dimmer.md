This is a guide on how to make the relay (controlling the 3-way valve) and dimmer (controlling the pump) independent on "Lego" (component) builds. 
Independent control allows proper phase recognition, calibration, and tracking.

# Notes
*   Pump and relay wire size recommendation is now â‰¤22 gauge because it is difficult to fit multiple 18 gauge wires into the screw terminals. 
*   Standard short-circuit protection calculations show that 22 gauge wire is permissible for known breakers 20 amps and under, however, this is smaller than standard. Your safety is your responsibility.

!> Powering your machine through a GFCI/AFCI/RCD device is recommended. 

# Guide
1. Disconnect pump source Line that is going to Dimmer L-IN. Tuck away the stock female spade (do not reconnect to the pump) and completely remove the wire that connected it to the Dimmer L-IN in the component housing.

2. Find the Line wire going from the coffee switch to the Relay and disconnect it (confirm, but if you followed the schematics exactly it should be connected to Relay COM).

3. Move the disconnected coffee switch Line wire to Dimmer L-IN (where you removed the pump wire). You may also want to swap this for a 22 gauge wire for ease of connecting jumpers in the next step.

4. Jumper from Dimmer L-IN to Relay COM, and from Relay COM to the snubber (if present). It is recommended to verify that your changes match the updated schematics. This completes the update.
