> Please understand that modifying your coffee machine involves working with potentially lethal mains level voltage. Do not undertake this project if this makes you uncomfortable. Understanding & utilizing safe electrical practices is critical to your safety and safely completing this project. Only start working on your machine while it's completely disconnected from the mains power socket. By agreeing to follow the below guide, you agree that the authors cannot be deemed responsible for any of the damage you induce to your house appliances, yourself, your cat, your friend, or your gold fish. It will be entirely your fault!

# Considerations
!> It is expected that when going through PCB install you will follow the [3PLN Stock Wiring Integration](guides-stm32/3pln-stock-wiring-integration.md) guide or figure out the custom wiring by yourself. Please note, these are only suggestions/food for thought/rough guidance. 

* If you want to do a custom harness:
  * The [10 A Resettable Thermal Fuse 185 C](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256805232358051.html) or **Rancilio Silvia Boiler Thermostat 165ยบ** (max steam temp of ~145) can be used for the thermal fuse. 
  * Get covers for spades, possibly hard covers. Stock boiler terminal covers for round boiler terminal connectors (**160783-7 TE**) cannot be purchased, a printable option is linked on the [Home page](readme.md#3d-printed-parts).
* Consider buying a XH and PH JST kit to make up your own.
* Know and study difference between HV and LV lines.
* Gaggia Classic New 2018/19 - ECO board must be bypassed or custom wiring used. PCB v3 can slot it into the pump tower where the eco board would be.
* PCB v3 is suitable for most single-boiler espresso machines. PCB v2 supports more connection points for wiring and and/or multiple boiler control. 
* PCB v2 housing links *(Pick one)*
  * [Rigid Housing](https://www.printables.com/model/260901)
  * [Easy Access Housing)](https://www.printables.com/model/261267)

# Programming/Flashing

!> Do not flash the Blackpill with the ST-Link while powering the system over USB-C.  

Flash the Blackpill using the ST-Link (connect SWDIO, GND, SWCLK, and 3.3V* - see [Prerequisites](prereq/prerequisites.md) for details). 

<img width="500" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117388662/262874364-c44f2eea-6a64-4731-adb8-a0c1a16089d6.png">

Flash the Nextion with the applicable nextion-*-lcd.tft on an otherwise-empty โค32 GB FAT32 microSD card.  

Power for flashing the Nextion may be provided through the USB-C port on the Blackpill so long as you are using a USB power adapter that will supply 4.6-5.2 VDC (don't use a battery bank or PC USB 2.0 ports for power).  

*If you wish to power the system through the 120 VAC PSU to flash the Blackpill then do **not** connect 3.3V to the ST-Link unless you're sure you do not have a knock-off/clone ST-Link.

Wait for the Nextion to show the "Update Successed! (sic)" message, turn off power, and then remove the microSD card.

# Component test

Connect the thermocouple to the terminals and power on the system once again. If all is successful you should:
- see a build number during boot (good Blackpill-Nextion communication)
- see a "filling boiler" message a few seconds after boot
- see a temperature reading on the screen that changes when heat is applied to the thermocouple
- see the SSR light turn on if the temperature is below the setpoint (it will flash if temp is close to setpoint)
- see a pressure value of 0.0 bar with no deviation
- *not* see the steam temp as the target
