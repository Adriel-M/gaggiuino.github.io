!> The Aliexpress hose IS NOT rated as high as the original SAECO hose, please use common sense when operating the machine if you can't buy the recommended original SAECO hose use the exact size recommended here as pressure resistance is determined by the hose diameter as well.

# Considerations
!> It is expected that when going through PCB install you are able to figure out most things by yourself. Please note, these are only suggestions/food for thought/rough guidance. 

* If you do a custom harness you can use the **Rancilio Silvia Boiler Thermostat 165ยบ** for a resettable thermal fuse and boiler terminals are **160783-7 TE**.
* Get covers for spades, possibly hard covers. Stock boiler terminal covers for round connectors cannot be purchased, a printable option is linked below.
* Consider buying a XH and PH JST kit to make up your own.
* Know and study difference between HV and LV lines.
* Gaggia Classic New 2018/19 - ECO board must be bypassed. Highly recommend getting PCB v3 as you can slot it into the pump tower where the eco board would be.
